# NJVM
A JVM backend for Nim! Likely isn't (and never will be) perfect, but it should at least let core types work and allow for use of Nim syntax instead of Java!

## Goals
  - To be usable in a way that benefits people who use Nim regularly and would like to develop for the JVM
  - To allow for libraries created for the Nim JVM backend in mind, to be usable in Java
  - More goals may be added overtime
